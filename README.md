# unicornhathd-fireworks
A simple demo of fireworks on the UnicornHatHD.

I included my own version of unicornhathd.py that adds safe_set_pixel(), draw_line() and draw_circle().

draw_line() algorithm adaped from:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm

draw_circle() algorithm adapted from:
